            <p>Fireflies is a tiny web-app that displays a hand-picked quote and background image each time you refresh the page.</p>

            <p>This project was inspired by Chibird's posts on Tumblr. <a href="http://chibird.com/post/74996652847/">One of her posts in particular stood out to me</a>, and soon after Fireflies was born.</p>

            <p>I created Fireflies so I could learn JavaScript, and along the way I discovered how useful and amazing things like <a href="http://angularjs.org">AngularJS</a>, <a href="http://npmjs.org">NPM</a>, <a href="http://bower.io">Bower</a>, and <a href="http://gruntjs.com">Grunt</a> can be.</p>
