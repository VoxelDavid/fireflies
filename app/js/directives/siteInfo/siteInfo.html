            <h1>About Fireflies</h1>

            <p>Fireflies is a little single-page application built off of <a href="http://angularjs.org">AngularJS</a>, with <a href="http://npmjs.org">NPM</a> and <a href="http://bower.io">Bower</a> handling my dependencies, and <a href="http://gruntjs.com">Grunt</a> running tasks to automate my build process &ndash; amongst other things.</p>

            <p>I was inspired to make Fireflies by <a href="http://i.imgur.com/DIU1JR7.png">about:mozilla</a> and the Tumblr user <a href="http://chibird.com">Chibird</a>. I loved some of her posts and I wanted to incorporate them into something, and with about:mozilla giving me a nice idea of where to start, Fireflies was born.</p>
