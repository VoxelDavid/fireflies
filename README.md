## Fireflies

Fireflies is a single-page application built off of [Angular.js](http://angularjs.org). It displays a quote and background image at random every time the page is loaded.

I've learned a lot since starting Fireflies, namely the awesomeness that is [Node Package Manager](http://npmjs.org), [Bower](bower.io), [Grunt](gruntjs.com) and of course [Angular.js](angularjs.org).

Fireflies was inspired by [Chibird's posts on Tumblr](http://chibird.com). I found one that I particularly [loved](http://chibird.com/post/74996652847/) and soon after Fireflies was born. It was merely a way for me to learn some stuff about JavaScript, now it's turned into a full blown application.

I wonder where I'll take it next? :)

Cheers!
