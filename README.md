## Fireflies

Fireflies is a single-page application built off of Angular.js. It displays a quote and background image at random every time the page is loaded.

I've learned a lot since starting Fireflies, namely the awesomeness that is [NPM], [Bower], [Grunt] and of course [Angular].

Fireflies was inspired by Chibird's posts on Tumblr. [One of her posts in particular] stood out to me, and soon after Fireflies was born. It was merely a way for me to learn some stuff about JavaScript, now it's turned into a full blown web app.

I wonder where I'll take it next :)

Cheers!
